# Temperature-Sensor
Temperature Sensor using C#, Delegates and Event handling 

In this project, I created a temperature sensor system with an alarm feature using C# and event-driven programming. I used events and delegates to notify different components (Display and AlarmSystem) when the temperature exceeds a certain threshold. The system allows users to set the current temperature and alarm value through the console. I learned how to implement event handling, manage custom event arguments, and design a sensor system using object-oriented principles.
